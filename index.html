  <h1>Welcome to Carson's About Me page!</h1>
  <p id="opening-paragraph">Why hello there! <em>Would you like to play a game?</em> Haha just kidding, I know you were kinda just forced to play anyway. I hoped you enjoyed yourself, and I hope you enjoy seeing how wrong you were.</p>

  <h2 class="questions">Unlike Adam, no, I don't have a dog.</h2>
  <p class="answers">Instead, I actually have rats. As of May 25th, 2017, I actually have 3 rats. I know you're probably asking "Hey Carson, why don't you have more rats?". That's a valid question. I mean come on, can you ever own too many rats?</p>
  <p>Here is even more fucking info, so much fucking info about me!!!</p>
