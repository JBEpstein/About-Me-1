    <div id="questions-and-answers">

      <p id="opening-paragraph">Why hello there! <em>Would you like to play a game</em>? Haha just kidding, I know you were kinda just forced to play one anyway. I hope you enjoyed yourself, friend. Check out the answers below to learn some more stuff about me!</p>

      <br></br>

      <h3 class="questions">Unlike Adam, no, I don't have a dog.</h3>
        <p class="answers">Instead, I actually have rats. As of May 25th, 2017, I actually have 3 rats. I know you're probably asking "Hey Carson, why don't you have more rats?". That's a valid question. I mean come on, can you ever own too many rats?</p>

      <h3 class="questions">Nikes are just the classic shoe, ya know?</h3>
          <p class="answers">Second only to Chucks or the oh-so-classic socks and sandals combo. Nikes are legit. Some (not me) would say they're <em>too</em> legit. I've also heard that a lot of their shoes are made in sweatshops too, which is actually really sad and unfortunate... maybe we should just stay positive here. Their shoes rock!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">My birthday? Why, it's in January of course!</h3>
        <p class="answers">It's that special day that comes but once a year, full of joy and Christmas cheer. My birthday, obviously! It's on January 23rd to be exact, so there's no way it could be next month. Unless you're reading this in February. If that's the case just disregard this one. My coding isn't perfect yet, alright?</p>

      <h3 class="questions">If I had to pick a favorite, it'd probably be Ben Foster.</h3>
        <p class="answers">Or Max Greenfield. That guy is <em>hilarious</em>. Seriously have you seen New Girl? Do yourself a favor, go watch it right now. Meryl Streep has to be an honorable mention as she is easily one of the best actors/actresses alive. Same with Daniel Day Lewis too! And who could forget about Kevin Spacey? He's everyone's favorite villain in House of Cards! Alright, maybe I don't have a favorite. Gotta give respect where respect is due!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">Some fifth question</h3>
        <p class="answers">Some fifth answer</p>
