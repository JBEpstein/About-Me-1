    <h1>Welcome to Carson's About Me page!</h1>

    <div id="questions-and-answers">

      <p id="opening-paragraph">Why hello there! <em>Would you like to play a game</em>? Haha just kidding, I know you were kinda just forced to play one anyway. I hope you enjoyed yourself, friend. Check out the answers below to learn some more stuff about me!</p>

      <br></br>

      <h3 class="questions">Unlike Adam, no, I don't have a dog.</h3>
        <p class="answers">Instead, I actually have rats. As of May 25th, 2017, I actually have 3 rats. I know you're probably asking "Hey Carson, why don't you have more rats?". That's a valid question. I mean come on, can you ever own too many rats? I've had rats for several years now, and in my completely non-biased opinion they are the best creatures to ever house as pets. They're intelligent and very unique with personalities and quirks that vary from rat to rat. Picture a dog, but way smaller, not as loud, and not at all like a dog now that I think about it... Great pets nonetheless!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">Nikes are just the classic shoe, ya know?</h3>
          <p class="answers">Second only to Chucks or the oh-so-classic socks and sandals combo. Nikes are legit. Some (not me) would say they're <em>too</em> legit. I've also heard that a lot of their shoes are made in sweatshops too, which is actually really sad and unfortunate... maybe we should just stay positive here. Their shoes rock!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">My birthday? Why, it's in January of course!</h3>
        <p class="answers">It's that special day that comes but once a year, full of joy and Christmas cheer. My birthday, of course! It's on January 23rd to be exact, so there's no way it could be next month. Unless you're reading this in February, and if that's the case just disregard this one. My coding isn't perfect yet, alright? As a side note, having a birthday so close to Christmas but not quite close enough to recieve combined birthday/christmas gifts was amazing growing up.</p>

      <h3 class="questions">If I had to pick a favorite actor, it'd probably be Ben Foster.</h3>
        <p class="answers">Or Max Greenfield. That guy is <em>hilarious</em>. Seriously have you seen New Girl? Do yourself a favor, go watch it right now. Meryl Streep has to be an honorable mention as she is easily one of the best actors/actresses alive. Same with Daniel Day Lewis too! And who could forget about Kevin Spacey? He's everyone's favorite villain in House of Cards! Alright, maybe I don't have a favorite. Gotta give respect where respect is due!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">Say it with me now: C-A-R-S-O-N!</h3>
        <p class="answers">Like Daily, Johnny, or the city in Nevada. So my name definitely isn't Carlton. But I honestly don't think I'd mind if it was. Little known fact about my name: it was almost "Henry" (my dad's idea). But apparently my mom intervened like "no let's make it a unique name everyone will always somehow butcher for the rest of his life."</p>
